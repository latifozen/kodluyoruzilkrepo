<h2> Sevdigim Enstürümanlar </h2>
<h3> Electro guitar</h3>
<p> 
    I am playing guitar almost 8 years. I was started by my high school music teacher. Then it talent goint to develop. And last five years ı switched to electro guitar. I like the sound of it. It feels happy to me. By the way ı like so much it  
 </p>
 <h3> Piona </h3>
 <p> In last days, ı was watching the piona videos. And ı was so inspiring him. Their sound so smooth, soft. Then, ı said to me; I am sure, ı want to learn it. Then I ordered. But it isn't piona. It is keybord. I couldn't get it. Because it is so expensive and huge. I can't arrange a place for it. Keybord both cheaper and smaller. So in last 2 month ı am trying to learn with youtube tutorial videos. I can play für elise and Üsküdar'a Giderirken with Keybord. As soon as possible ı will improve myself in this field. </p>

 <h4> Thank you :) </h4>
